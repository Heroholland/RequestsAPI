# RequestsAPI
## Introduction
The Java requests API is a simple Java API to solve all of your problems. This project was created with absolutely 0 dependencies so all you have to do is drag and drop the .jar file into your project's build path and you are ready to go.
## Credits
### I would like to largely dedicate the credits of this project to the main source: https://www.baeldung.com/java-http-request. This project was created to expand on the source's  code and make it simpler for the programmer to use it. 
*(Let's be honest. It's kind of hard to actually follow along with their tutorial)*.

## Use
I would like to make clear that this is a more advanced API for simple use.
